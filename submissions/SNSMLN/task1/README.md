Hello!

My name is SNSMLN. I'm a non-institutional validator, crypto enthusiast, data miner, administrator, programmer, and Web3 user. And, of course, I'm an experienced blockchain specialist with deep knowledge in system administration, programming, and testing.

I enjoy:
- Testing new software,
- Solving installation issues,
- Exploring new directions in Web3.
Yes, usually, it doesn't bring money, but I still enjoy it.

I have:
- Practical experience: Successfully launched and maintained numerous nodes, participated in various projects.
- Results-oriented: I constantly strive to optimize and improve system performance.
- In-depth knowledge: I have a deep understanding of the principles of blockchain operation and protocols.
- Enthusiasm: My passion for blockchains motivates me to constantly develop and seek new solutions.
I am ready to share my knowledge and experience to develop a decentralized future.

I am an experienced node tester in various blockchains, such as: Cosmos Tendermint, Polkadot, NEAR, Fort APTOS, StarkNet.

I run nodes in multiple locations. I prefer to use my own bare-metal servers, but I also use rented dedicated servers and very rarely ordinary VPS.
My standard server configuration: Ryzen 5950X, 128GB RAM, 8TB NVMe.

I choose interesting projects for testing that influence the development of the ecosystem, not just another clone of Ethereum or Cosmos.

I also have several nodes in mainnets, such as Muon, NEAR, Humanode, Minima, Forta, Haqq, Tangle.

I freely manage a large number of servers running Linux with various nodes installed. I have extensive programming experience in Bash, JS, and other languages.

I am a member of the SystemD DAO - a small private group of experienced crypto enthusiasts.

For monitoring, I use many tools, both in real-time and over a period of time. Programs like top, iotop, netstat, and nload are constantly running on the server. For long-term monitoring, I use Grafana and atop.

For notifications, I use the Grafana notification service for general server monitoring and a custom Telegram bot for monitoring each specific node.

To ensure validator security, I use standard Linux tools: SSH key login to the server, monitoring login attempts, using separate accounts with limited privileges, using root access only through sudo, and a firewall. All unused server ports are closed. To protect validator and node keys, I use LUKS encryption.

To reduce validator downtime in case of hardware or software failures on the mainnet, I use a backup server. On the backup server, nodes operate only in the mode of a participant in the p2p network, not a validator. If necessary, I only need to replace the node and validator keys and restart the corresponding service. I also have backup copies of all necessary keys, node settings, and my own scripts for quickly starting a node.
